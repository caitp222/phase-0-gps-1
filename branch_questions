
Why feature branches are important? Keeps the master branch clean. Allows more than one developer to work on a project as once. 
What is a branch? One continuous direction of code with a series of pointers that are moved to represent new commits.
Creating a branch: git branch <name>
Navigating between branches: git checkout <name of branch>
