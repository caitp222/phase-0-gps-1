###What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I had the basic concepts clear in my head but I definitely needed more clarity on why Git was structured like this and what it allowed people using it to do.

###What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

How to define a git branch. I was struggling to articulate the concept and our guide helped a lot with that. He also explained how keeping your local repository up to date meant you could work through any merge conflicts locally and avoid encoutering them in Github.

###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

We both asked the guide to clarify some Git concepts to us.

###What still confuses you about Git?

There isn't anything I've done that I find confusing, but I know I still don't see the full potential of Git.

###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I know that my pair was very capable but not entirely prepared for the session, which did make it more difficult. But overall it was interesting and proved to be useful to me in the other pairing sessions this week.
